Properties of sorting:

1. Comparison / Non Comparison - In non-comparison based sorting, elements of array are not compared with each other to find the sorted array. 
2. In-place/Outplace technique – A sorting technique is inplace if it does not use any extra memory to sort the array. 
3. Online/Offline technique – A sorting technique is considered Online if it can accept new data while the procedure is ongoing i.e. complete data is not required to   start the sorting operation. 
4. Stable/Unstable technique – A sorting technique is stable if it does not change the order of elements with the same value.
